# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

# OOP is programming paradigm that can make code more secure through Encapsulation, which essentially hides code base from the program so that it cannot be modified. 
# On the other hand it allows for more maintanable, modular code through polymorphism. Polymorhism is achieved through Inheritance and mix-ins
# Polymorphism
# Encapsulation
# Inheritance
