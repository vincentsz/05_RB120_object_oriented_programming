# What is the difference between states and behaviors?

# State is scoped at the object level and is therefore unique to every object. In ruby state is saved in instance variables. 
# Behavior is scoped at the class level, meaning that behaviors are shared between objects of the same class(or subclasses). 

# not so sure about this!!!
# In ruby behaviors are defined in instance and class methods.????
